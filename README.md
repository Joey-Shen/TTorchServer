T-Torch is the world's first search engine for trajectory data, which is built over our research paper below:

```

## Supported queries 
T-Torch is able to efficiently answer two typical types of queries now:
* Boolean search
  * Range query
  * Path query
  * Strict path query
* Top K similarity search, we support a list of well-known similarity measures:
  * Longest overlapped road segments (LORS)
  * Dynamic time wrapping (DTW)
  * Longest common sub-sequence (LCSS)
  * Edit distance with real penalty (EDR)
  * Hausdorff distance
  * Discrete Fr√©chet Distance

## Features of framework
* T-Torch performs trajectory search over the mapped trajectories.
  * Optimized map-matching algorithms over Graphhopper
  * Ligtweight data storage
* Fast search with
  * Compressiable index
  * Various similarity measures
* Trajectory visualization on real road network
  * Comming soon...


## Getting started
### 1. Map matching

Map matching is the technique for projecting raw trajectories onto real road network.

```
MapMatching mm = MapMatching.getBuilder().build("Resources/porto_raw_trajectory.txt","Resources/porto.osm.pbf");
mm.start();
```

The first argument is to specify your raw trajectory data src, while the second argument *"Resources/porto.osm.pbf"* is an PBF file<sup>[1]</sup>
After setup, start() method is to convert raw trajectories to mapped trajectories. and the results 
be stored in *Torch* folder under CWD, which will be used for query processing part later.

#### Note:
```
trajectoryID [[latitude1,longtitude1],[latitude2,longtitude2],...]
```
 1. the format of trajectory data should be the same as it in sample dataset, and there is a **"\t"** separating trajectory id and content of it
 2. it is your part to take care of data cleansing, as high length trajectory (over 200) could slow down mapping process rapidly, and low quality trajectory leads to low projection rate. 


### 2. Index construction
After preprocessing, Torch can build indices for map matched trajectories.
Torch supports three types of indices in total:  
1. **GridIndex** is used for indexing trajectory points. It first uniformly partitions the whole area into small rectangles. Then build the inverted vertexInvertedIndex of trajectory points based on those rectangles.  
2. **EdgeIndex (EdgII)** is an inverted vertexInvertedIndex for trajectory edges.  
3. **NodeIndex (VerII)** is an inverted vertexInvertedIndex for trajectory points.  

Before using any vertexInvertedIndex, please first declare them as follows:
```
@Autowired
NodeIndex nodeIndex;
@Autowired
EdgeIndex edgeIndex;
@Autowired
GridIndex gridIndex;
...
```
After declaring, buildIndex() should be called to build the vertexInvertedIndex.
#### Index compression (optional)
After invoking buildIndex(), all indices will be stored in the disk in plain text. Because the vertexInvertedIndex consists of a sequence of integers, it can be compressed by delta encoding and re-stored in binary form in the disk.
This can be done by calling compress() for each vertexInvertedIndex.

### 3. Queries
After the vertexInvertedIndex is built, it can be loaded in the plain text form or compressed binary form using the following code:
```
edgeIndex.load(); // or
edgeIndex.loadCompressedForm();
```
Under three types of indices, Torch supports four types of queries:
#### 1) Range query
Range query is used to retrieve trajectories passing through a specified rectangle area.
Given a torPoint and a radius r, it can be done with the help of NodeIndex and GridIndex.
```
List<Integer> trajectoryIDs = nodeIndex.rangeQuery(gridIndex, torPoint, r, null);
```
#### 2) Path query
Path<sup>[2]</sup> is used to retrieve trajectories containing any edge of the given path.
```
List<Integer> trajectoryIDs = edgeIndex.pathQuery(originalSegments, null);
```
#### 3) Strict path query
Strict path query<sup>[2]</sup> is used to retrieve trajectories strictly passing through the entire path from beginning to end.
```
List<Integer> trajectoryIDs = edgeIndex.strictPathQuery(querySegments, null);
```
#### 4) Top-k trajectory similarity query
A top-k trajectory similarity search query returns
the k highest ranked trajectories based on the specified similarity metric.
Torch supports six similarity metrics: DTW, LCSS, EDR, and LORS.  
```
Map<Integer, MMEdge> allEdgeMap = new HashMap<>();
Map<Integer, MMPoint> allPointMap = new HashMap<>();
getGraphMap(allEdgeMap, allPointMap);
Map<Integer, Trajectory> trajectoryMap = loadTrajectoryTxtFile(trajectoryFile, pointFile, edgeFile, true);
Trajectory query; //This is the query

```
Using our new proposed similarity model LORS:
```
edgeIndex.load(); //or edgeIndex.loadCompressedForm();
List<MMEdge> querySegments = query.getMapMathedTrajectory(allEdges);
double[] restDistance = new double[querySegments.size()];
for (int i = querySegments.size() - 2; i >= 0 && i + 1 < querySegments.size(); --i)
    restDistance[i] = restDistance[i + 1] + querySegments.get(i + 1).getLength();
edgeIndex.findTopK(querySegments, k, allEdges, restDistance);

```

```
Using DTW:  
```
gridIndex.delete();
if (!gridIndex.load()) {
    gridIndex.buildIndex(allPointMap, epsilon);
}
...
List<Integer> trajectoryID = gridIndex.findTopK(trajectoryMap, allPointMap, query, k, measureType);
```
Using LCSS and EDR:
```
if (!nodeIndex.load()) {
    nodeIndex.buildIndex(trajectoryMap.values()); //or use nodeIndex.loadCompressedForm();
}
gridIndex.delete();
if (!gridIndex.load()) {
    gridIndex.buildIndex(allPointMap, epsilon);
...
nodeIndex.findTopK(gridIndex, query, k, measureType, trajLenMap);
